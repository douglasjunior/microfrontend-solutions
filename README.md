# Microfrontends with Vite, React, and TypeScript: Solutions, Comparisons, and Recommendations

## Module Federation

Created by the Webpack team in version 5, led by Zackary Jackson, **Module Federation** addresses the dynamic sharing of modules between applications. It is maintained by the Webpack community.

### Pros

- **Compatibility with Vite**: The official plugin `@module-federation/vite` simplifies integration with Vite, supporting ES Modules and TypeScript directly without third-party dependencies.
- **Compatibility with React**: Robust support for React, enabling the sharing of components and libraries such as React and ReactDOM.
- **Dependency Sharing**: Allows sharing dependencies via NPM packages or external URLs, with support for singletons to avoid multiple instances of common libraries.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Centralized configuration in `vite.config.ts`, supporting dynamic remotes and runtime integration.
- **Documentation**: Well-structured and updated documentation with practical examples for various scenarios.
- **Developer Experience**: Smooth integration with Vite's development environment, enabling fast builds and efficient hot module replacement for the host.
- **Independent Deployment**: Microfrontends can be deployed independently of the host. Changes in remotes are reflected in the host without requiring a redeployment of the host.

### Cons

- **Limited Development Mode**: When running multiple connected projects, only the host can run directly in development mode; remotes must be pre-built.
- **Initial Complexity**: Configuring remotes and shared dependencies can be confusing for beginners, especially in large projects.

## Single-SPA

Developed by Joel Denning and maintained by the community, **Single-SPA** allows integration of multiple frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) into a single application.

### Pros

- **Compatibility with React**: Official support for React via `single-spa-react`, simplifying lifecycle integration.
- **Technological Flexibility**: Enables combining multiple frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) in a single applicationâ€”useful for migrations or heterogeneous teams.
- **Developer Experience**: Supports isolated development of individual microfrontends without needing to run the entire application.
- **Independent Deployment**: Each microfrontend can be deployed independently of the host. Import maps allow the host to consume updated versions of remotes without redeployment.

### Cons

- **Unofficial Integration with Vite**: Relies on a third-party plugin (`vite-plugin-single-spa`) to adapt Vite projects to Single-SPA specifications.
- **Dependency Sharing**: Uses import maps with external URLs to share dependencies between microfrontends, making version control via NPM infeasible.
- **Limited Documentation**: While comprehensive in some areas, documentation can be confusing for beginners and does not cover all practical cases.
- **Complex Configuration**: Manual configuration of lifecycles and import maps for shared modules can be labor-intensive in large projects.

## GarfishJS

Created and maintained by Bytedance (the company behind TikTok), **GarfishJS** is heavily based on Single-SPA and prioritizes microfrontend isolation using techniques like sandboxing.

### Pros

- **Compatibility with Vite**: Basic support for ES Modules allows integration with Vite; however, there is no specific documentation on advanced usage with Vite.
- **Compatibility with React**: Supports React through official modular APIs.
- **Strong Isolation**: Provides sandboxing to isolate microfrontends, preventing global conflicts between applications.
- **Modular Configuration**: Allows granular configurations for loading and communication between microfrontends.
- **Independent Deployment**: Microfrontends can be deployed independently of the host. Changes in remotes are automatically reflected in the host without redeployment.

### Cons

- **Limited and Outdated Documentation**: Most documentation is available only in Chinese, making it difficult for global developers to use.
- **Development Mode Issues**: Remote microfrontends only work when compiled; they cannot run directly in development mode connected to the host.
- **Limited Dependency Sharing**: No native support for sharing via NPM; relies exclusively on manual configuration or external URLs (unless using ModernJS or Rspack).

|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Compatibility with Vite            | High (official plugin)               | Moderate (third-party plugin)      | Moderate (basic ES Modules support) |
| Compatibility with React           | High                                 | High                               | High                              |
| Configuration                      | Moderate (manual adjustments needed) | Complex (lifecycles + import maps) | Moderate (sandbox + specific APIs) |
| Dependency Sharing                 | Via NPM or external URLs             | External URLs only                 | Limited with Vite; depends on bundler-specific setup |
| Documentation                      | Updated and comprehensive            | Limited in some aspects            | Limited; mostly in Chinese         |
| Developer Experience               | Good (independent dev possible; connected requires build) | Excellent (independent or connected dev supported) | Good (independent dev possible; connected requires build) |
| Dev Mode Connected to Host         | No                                   | Yes                                | No                                |

## Conclusion

1. Use **Module Federation (@module-federation/vite)** if you seek high performance during development, robust dependency sharing, official support for Vite, and hassle-free independent deployments.
2. Opt for **Single-SPA** if you need to integrate multiple frameworks and manage complex lifecycles but are prepared for a steeper initial learning curve.
3. Consider **GarfishJS** if strong isolation is essential and independent deployments are a priority. However, be aware of its limitations in development mode and documentation. It is more suitable for projects based on ModernJS or Rspack.
